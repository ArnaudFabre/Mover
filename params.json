{"name":"Mover","tagline":"2D homogeneous coordinates toolkit","body":"# Mover\r\n\r\nMover Framework allows to combine 2D transformations like \r\n* translations\r\n* rotations\r\n* homotheties\r\n    \r\nIt is based on homogeneous coordinates that allows to keep in a unique 3x3 matrix the combination of multiple plane transformations.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nCreate a new mover instance:\r\n```\r\n    var myMove = Mover();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTranslate it by 1 in x direction and 2 in y direction :\r\n```\r\n    myMove.translate(1, 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRotate it by 90 degrees:\r\n```   \r\n    myMove.rotate(90);\r\n```\r\nScale it by 2 in x and y direction (origin is always local 0,0) :\r\n```\r\n    myMove.scale(2);\r\n```\r\n    \r\nApply transformation to a 2D point\r\n```\r\n    var newPosition = myMove.apply([1,1]);\r\n    newPosition = myMove.apply(1,0);\r\n```\r\n    \r\nYou can of course chained transformations\r\n```\r\n    var newPosition = Mover().translate(1,2).rotate(90).scale(2).apply([1,1]);\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
